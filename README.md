Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and accounts for 60-80% of the 944,000 people living with dementia today (Luengo-Fernandez & Landeiro, 2023). Traditional diagnostic techniques rely on clinical assessments, that evaluate cognitive and memory functions, medical history, and neurological exams. However, ascertaining an AD diagnosis using these techniques alone remains challenging.

The application of machine learning and deep learning techniques have demonstrated promising results in accurately distinguishing AD from cognitively normal (CN) individuals. Despite these positive outcomes, our comprehension of the early stages of AD, known as the prodromal stages, remains limited. Specifically, there is a lack of understanding regarding the factors that distinguish a patient with stable mild cognitive impairment (sMCI) from one with progressive mild cognitive impairment (pMCI), as well as the triggers that may lead to progression in the latter group. By leveraging magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data and utilizing deep learning techniques, researchers can potentially identify patterns and features that can distinguish between AD and MCI patients. Nonetheless, further work is required to differentiate between AD and MCI and comprehend the progression between the two disease states.

In this study a convolutional neural network (CNN) model was designed and developed for classifying AD and MCI, with the potential for extracting features useful in predicting the conversion of MCI to AD. Two datasets, comprising of midsagittal and parasagittal images, consisting of 180 AD, 105 sMCI and 83 pMCI patients were acquired from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) repository. The images were labelled based on their respective classes, pre-processed using the Gamma correction method to enhance pixel brightness. Subsequently, the dataset was split into an 80:20 ratio, with 80% for training and 20% for testing in the classification task. The proposed classifier was trained on the two datasets and successfully classified the midsagittal data into groups AD and MCI with an accuracy of 98.1% along with 97.2% specificity and 99.0% sensitivity and the parasagittal data with 97.8% accuracy and 97.0% and 98.5% for specificity and sensitivity respectively.

This study presents an innovative and accurate technique for classifying MCI and AD. The results surpass existing literature on the classification of these two states and hold promise for enhancing our understanding of the relationship between MCI and AD serving as a predictive tool for the progression from one clinical state to another.
